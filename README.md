## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

```css
.bottomimage {
  max-width: 700px;
  max-height: 350px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
}
```


### Continued development

Positioning Elements with absolute positioning, especially when only a specific part of an image is to be displayed.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://webplatform.github.io/docs/tutorials/absolute_and_fixed_positioning/) - This helped me for positioning the details division over image.
